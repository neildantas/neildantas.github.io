I was manufactured<br/>
by injection moulding technique<br/>
by a Co. of 2 individuals<br/>
Alex Dantas & Rosy Dantas [my parents]<br/>
on the 5th of November 1978<br/>
exactly after 9 months they said<br/>
"I DO" (doers they were)<br/>
<br/>
But not gOOd plaNNers (no negativity intended)<br/>
But necessary for you to know<br/>
coz that's what i gueSS made me<br/>
what I'm today.<br/>
<br/>
My dad had no bank balance / property<br/>
& thus worked hard to keep his 3 children moving.<br/>
They told me when i was a kid i was very hyper-active (stiLL am)<br/>
& used to bang my hands / head on the ground<br/>
[putting those tOOls to bad use]<br/>
Thus they gave me crayons right from the beginning<br/>
to distract me. The most colourful / inspiring things to me.<br/>
that i used to colour my 220 sq ft home [my canvas]<br/>
That's still my home where we still pay rent.<br/>
...<br/>
Was not fortunate to read books / novels / mags<br/>
dad couldn't afford it. Moms a house-wife.<br/>
Infact i was fortunate as i had no favourite heros / idols / authors / inspirations<br/>
But ya my dad could take me by feet to all the places he went<br/>
& i was observing. (unlucky other rich kids moving in their UVcoated cars who didn't see much)<br/>
i know Bombay so very well that i could earn a living being a Guide to the tourist.<br/>
I just LOVE BOMBAY [its in my blOOd]<br/>
V.T., Gateway, Local trains, taxis, BEST Buses, People of diFFerent caste,<br/>
Chowpatty, Horse Tonga, malabar HiLL, the rich ppl there,<br/>
vintage cars, old parsi antiques, chor-bazaar, street art, film posters,<br/>
signage's at time was handcrafted, the speed, the air, noise,<br/>
so much colour. I was absorbing aLL of that.<br/>
...<br/>
I could only sketch / paint at home<br/>
They then realised that im an artist<br/>
so was taken to art galleries / museums ...<br/>
more colours, got inspired<br/>
Thought that MFHussain, Raza, Bava, MarioMiranda were there greatest<br/>
But never wanted to be them. They were not anyone else. They were them.<br/>
started even imitating art that i liked whilst i was a kid modifying it with my style / stroke.<br/>
i stopped going to art galleries as it was getting to commercialized<br/>
& ppl sold canvases that they wiped their used brushes which they caLLed abstract masterpieces.<br/>
I hated that. so in my adolescence I switched to magazines.<br/>
DEBONAIR...you know why. Cindy Crawford was my favourite.<br/>
I maybe learned elements of form there more than i learned at NID - Ahmedabad<br/>
& Ya I'm sure thats how i got my naughtier side active. [shows in my work na]<br/>
i have a pile of aLL my old paintings with dates stiLL.<br/>
...<br/>
now expenses were getting high / school fees / dads drinking<br/>
i started making commercial paintings (ganeshas / jesus & mary...) in my style ofcourse.<br/>
& sold it for peanuts during Diwali / Christmas...<br/>
...<br/>
Dad expired in an aCCident in 1999 (he was only 48)<br/>
i had to work & coLLege together (Sir JJ SchOOL of Art) Interior Design.<br/>
Thus was in bad bOOks with those bias profs there [not all]<br/>
as i most of the time did work outside to make the money<br/>
they never knew that i had lost my Dad. I didn't want them to know.<br/>
Didn't nEEd sympathy.<br/>
...<br/>
What was my Job:<br/>
i worked in a Christian Cemetery<br/>
designing monuments for the dead<br/>
making alternatives for the church layouts<br/>
But primarily job was to paint the RIP wooden crosses.<br/>
I got Rs. 20/- per cross. thus waited for 5 ppl to die to make a 100 rupEEs.<br/>
my boSS (a very nice person) felt guilty abt my situation<br/>
& oFFered me my oFFicial salary of 1,300/-<br/>
i could pay my sem fEEs Rs.90 only as i was getting scholarship at JJs<br/>
...<br/>
i wasn't aware of Design as a subject then<br/>
But fiLLed the mandatory NID application form.<br/>
And got selected. But we never had the money for that education.<br/>
But as only 10 students were selected for the course at NID from aLL over india<br/>
it was a sign / caLLing<br/>
& i decided that if i could make the initial amount before the due date to join NID<br/>
it'LL be my destiny to join. And it was. I got a lotta help from my friends, family & that cemetery boss.<br/>
And took a huge loan form the bank. That I'm stiLL paying back.<br/>
How at times i wished i was RICH. But I'm sure I wouldn't be me then...lol.<br/>
so im so haPPy. satisfied / complete & graduaLLy geTTing there>>><br/>
I have No limits...I feel i have just one life. I was not responsible for my Birth nor my day of death.<br/>
But what i have in betwEEn is mine & as long as i have it. I'm goNNa extract every bit ouTTa it.<br/>
& give back / leave egs. as weLL.<br/>
